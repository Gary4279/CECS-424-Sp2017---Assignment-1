The TV and the Xbox are both on. It seems like Gary was playing not too long ago. The name of the Xbox account reads 'Gary4279'.

The safe is here.  
The description of the safe is "The safe takes a 4 digit combination, something important must be inside." Instead of opening the safe, say "Instructions to open safe, type 'spin dial to (passcode)'" 

[Adding a tempting trick for the player. Sould the player eat it, they will die. It serves as a small obstacle.]
The chocolate is here. "There is a very tasty looking chocolate bar on the couch."
The chocolate is edible.

[Letting the game understand different ways that players would type chocolate.]

The Safe is closed and fixed in place. Understand "dial" as the Safe. 

[Defining an action that will allow the player to interact and open the safe]
Spinning it to is an action applying to one thing and one number. Check spinning it to: if the noun is not the Safe, say "Nothing happened." instead. Report spinning it to: say "Safe is already open." 

[Chaning how the game understands user input to a form that the game understands and can work with,]
Understand "spin [something] to [a number]" as spinning it to. 

[When the player inputs the correct passcode, the safe opens.]
